## ⭐ Inspiration

We were inspired by the lack of accomadations for people with disabilites in the Austin area so we partnered with activist groups on campus to understand
the unmet needs in the community and how we could provide a solution to their problems.

## 🚀 What it Does

It is a yelp-like application that rates restaurants in the Austin area with an accomadation rating and displays the top options on a map that a user
can look through to determine where they want to eat. It also provides a platform to provide reviews and ratings for these restaurants.

## 💎 How I built it

- We used the google maps API as the front landing page to show restaurants near the location of the user. We made use of React-Native to build 
an app that would simultaneously work with Apple and Android devices. Finally, we used Expo for testing on our phones. 

## 🤘 Challenges I ran into

- This was my first time working on full-stack development or any kind of app development so the entire tech stack was new to me.
- Learning how to set up and work with react-native was a bit of a challenge in the beginning.
- I had previously never worked with calling apis and integrating them into my codebase so that was also a learning process for me.

## 🏆 Accomplishments that I'm proud of

- I'm proud of myself for learning the tech stack as quickly as I could
- I am also happy that I had a chance to see a project through its entire lifecycle. From conception, to talking to parties with a vested interest, to general audience testing and whiteboarding, to execution, and finally a demo.
